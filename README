0. Setup shared storage filesystem with controller vm in it.

1. Setup etcd in hosts and controller.

2. Add key/value to etcd like this:

    openstack/controller_ip
    openstack/current_host
    openstack/gateway
    openstack/service_health
    openstack/next_host
    openstack/timestamp

3. Add a service in controller with these functions:

    Ping gateway OK?
    Service check OK?
    Write service_health.

    If OK and timestamp > 1 minites:
        
        Write timestamp

    else:

        DO NOT Write timestamp

3. Add a service in hosts with these functions:

    Ping gateway OK?

        I'm out of service, stop service.

    Read service_health OK?
        
        If I'm current_host, restart controller vm once.
        If still not good, 

    Ping controller OK?
    Ping current_host OK?

    If one of above is no:

        Ping next host OK?

        If OK:

            If I'm next_host:

                start the controller vm on me.
                Write current_host with my IP.

            else:

                Wait

        else:

            If timestamp > 5 minites:

                Write timestamp with current_time
                Write me to next_host

            else:

                Wait
